# Traffic characteristic estimation from large scale trajectory dataset
The code in this repositroy was part of a masters thesis.
The trajectory data acquired by drones from the pNEUMA Experiment are linked to the underlying network to get macroscopic traffic characteristics at any location in the network by placing vortual loops.

Using the code is pretty straightforward, first transforming the dataset to the right format, afterwards extracting the network of the research area and mapmatching all trajectories to this network.
For more information I refer to the thesis text in this repository
